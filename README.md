## Description
YourHealthLog is an Android app born to accommodate my needs to have a place
where to log everything relevant to my health.

## Functionalities
The main functionalities I'm working to include are:
- Biometric access ❌
- Weight tracking (also connecting to Google Health) ❌
- Calories and macro tracking ❌
- Internal custom DB for food macros ❌
- Body measurements ❌
- Training schedule ❌
- Training logs ❌
- Custom logs ❌

## Isn't there another app that covers this?
Probably, but it was either incomplete with respect to my needs, or I had to
pay for it, so why not spend an ungodly amount of hours to understand how
Kotlin and Android development work.
